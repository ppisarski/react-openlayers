# react-openlayers

## ReactJS and OpenLayers map component

### Getting started

[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) documentation provides an exelent explanation on how to get started with this framework by creating a [single-page app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html). 

    npx create-react-app map

Here, I wanted to demonstrate how to add a Map component to the app by using [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/).

Install OpenLayers with 

    npm install ol --save
